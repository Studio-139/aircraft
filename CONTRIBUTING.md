# Contributing

Thanks for helping.

- Discuss large changes first by opening an issue.
- Use feature branches. Example: feat panel mfd, fix rotor anim.
- Keep PRs small and focused. Include screenshots where useful.
- Follow STYLEGUIDE 3D for Blender and STYLEGUIDE CODE for configs and scripts.
- Put large binaries under Git LFS. CI will fail if you commit them without LFS.

## Development requirements
- MSFS SDK 2024
- Blender 4.x
- Optional: Wwise for sound work
